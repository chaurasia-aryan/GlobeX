"""Transaction Compliance Gate (Phase 8, per 08_TRANSACTION_COMPLIANCE_GATE.md).

The single deterministic gate before trade creation, escrow creation,
marketplace activation, shipment release, or payment release. Orchestrates:

  1. current_facts.py   — tariff/RTA/export-control/country-sanctions facts
  2. entity_screening.py — OFAC SDN + UN entity/restricted-party screening

into one CLEAR / REVIEW / BLOCKED / UNSUPPORTED decision.

Design rules (matches the rest of src/compliance/):
* UNSUPPORTED != CLEAR. REVIEW != CLEAR. Never conflate.
* A verified applicable prohibition (BLOCKED) can never be overridden by a
  high commercial/market-opportunity score — this module doesn't even
  accept one as input, by design, so it structurally cannot happen.
* Escrow may only proceed on CLEAR. BLOCKED/REVIEW/UNSUPPORTED all disable
  it (08_TRANSACTION_COMPLIANCE_GATE.md "Escrow" section).
* Fail closed throughout: if a dependency (current_facts registry, entity
  registry) is unavailable, the gate decision is UNSUPPORTED, never CLEAR.
